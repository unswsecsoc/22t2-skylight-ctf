## Description
My father had a safe with a plate inside saying, {ZONP_XGDY_NP_O0_MIODAS_TYG3} thats encoded with a cipher from WW1.
Along with the safe there was another sheet with 3 numbers, [075, 069, 089].

I wonder what it says on the plate?

### Walkthrough
1. Recognise that the cipher being used is a Playfair Cipher
2. Decode the 3 numbers to be ASCII characters that spell KEY
3. Use this KEY in an online decoder for the Playfair cipher to obtain the flag
