### Idea
JSFuck code with a character missing

### Walkthrough
1. Write a script to insert `!` characters at every location and run the resulting code with Node.js

OR

2. Compare the given code to similar code generated by http://www.jsfuck.com/ and insert an `!` at the first differing position

In both cases, the possible correct positions for the `!` are 1599 and 1600
