I accidentally pushed a *second* flag to the same repository as last time, but just to be on the safe side I'm not going to give you the commit hash of the orphaned commit with the new flag. Y'know, sekurity and all that. Surely there's no way you'll be able to recover this orphan commit without me telling you the hash!
