I created a tiny GitHub repository over at [https://github.com/unswsecsoc/skylightctf22_amend](https://github.com/unswsecsoc/skylightctf22_amend) and I accidentally stored some of my flags there, but fortunately I redacted it by amending my commit! I just checked the commit history, and the commit hash (c09728a03b211e02e83bb4c57652fd8d2b6c9f42) of the commit when I added the flag is no longer in the history.

This means my flags are safe ...right?
